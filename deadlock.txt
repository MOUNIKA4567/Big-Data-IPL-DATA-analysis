In concurrent computing, a deadlock is a state in which each member of a group waits for another member, including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a lock.
Deadlocks are a common problem in multiprocessing systems, parallel computing, and distributed systems, where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization.

In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. 
If a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock.

In a communications system, deadlocks occur mainly due to lost or corrupt signals rather than resource contention.
